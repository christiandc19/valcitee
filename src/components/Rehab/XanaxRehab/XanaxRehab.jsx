              <p>Xanax addiction is a condition characterized by the compulsive use of Xanax (alprazolam), a prescription medication used to treat anxiety and panic disorders.

                <li>Withdrawal symptoms when not using Xanax.</li>
                <li>Neglecting responsibilities at work, school, or home.</li>
                <li>Changes in behavior, including secrecy and withdrawal from social activities.</li>
                <li>Physical signs such as drowsiness, confusion, or slurred speech.</li>

                  <li>Previous Substance Use: Prior misuse of other drugs or alcohol can increase the risk of addiction.</li>
                </ol>

              <p>
                Our outpatient program offers a personalized treatment plan that includes therapy, support groups, and relapse prevention. We focus on empowering individuals through evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing to build coping strategies and prevent relapse. <br />
                With the flexibility to attend sessions on a schedule that suits your lifestyle, our outpatient program allows you to progress at your own pace while receiving the high-quality care needed to overcome addiction and regain control.

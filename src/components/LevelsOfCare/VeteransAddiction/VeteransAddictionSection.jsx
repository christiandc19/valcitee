              <h1>Comprehensive Care for Veterans</h1>
              <p>
                Veterans often face distinct challenges that can lead to substance use, including PTSD, depression, and other service-related trauma. Our program integrates evidence-based therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), to address these underlying issues and promote lasting recovery.
                <br /> Our team understands the complexities of military life and provides compassionate, respectful care designed to meet each veteran’s personal recovery goals. We work to help veterans break free from addiction, regain their health, and rebuild a fulfilling life post-service.

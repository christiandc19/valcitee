              <h2>Understanding Inhalant Addiction</h2>
              <p>
                Inhalant addiction occurs when individuals misuse common household substances—such as paint thinners, glues, and aerosols—to achieve a temporary high. These chemicals, often found in easily accessible products, are inhaled to experience mind-altering effects. Inhalants pose serious health risks, including brain damage, organ failure, and sudden death, making this form of addiction particularly dangerous. 
              </p>

              <h2>Signs of Inhalant Addiction</h2>
              <p>
                Recognizing inhalant addiction can be challenging because the signs may be subtle. However, common indicators include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Frequent use of household products like glue, paint, or cleaning fluids without a valid purpose.</li>
                  <li>Chemical smells on breath or clothing.</li>

                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>If you observe these signs, it’s crucial to intervene and seek professional help before the addiction worsens.</p>

              <p>

                      <li>Contingency Management (CM): Offers rewards for positive behaviors, such as staying sober and attending therapy sessions.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <li>Support Groups and 12-Step Programs</li>
                  <p>
                    Peer support is vital in maintaining recovery. Attending groups like Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or inhalant-specific support networks helps individuals build a strong foundation for long-term sobriety.
